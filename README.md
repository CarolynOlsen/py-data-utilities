# py-utilities
Small pieces of code that I frequently lookup. Currently this includes: 
* `call-dotenv.py`: load in environment variables from a .env file
* `query-postgres.py`: an example of connecting to then passing a SQL query to a PostgreSQL database
* `pip-upgrade-all`: from a script, call pip commands to upgrade all packages
